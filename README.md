Spending 20 minutes in front of a PC screen can have several effects on a person. Some of the possible effects include:

Eye strain: Staring at a screen for a prolonged period can cause eye strain, dry eyes, and blurred vision.

Headaches: Eye strain and the blue light emitted by computer screens can cause headaches.

Neck and shoulder pain: Poor posture and sitting in the same position for a long time can cause neck and shoulder pain.

Fatigue: Staring at a screen for a long time can lead to fatigue and tiredness.

Sleep disturbances: Exposure to blue light from computer screens can disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep at night.

Reduced productivity: The combination of fatigue, headaches, and other effects can reduce productivity and concentration.

To minimize the effects of spending time in front of a computer screen, it's important to take regular breaks. 

To help reduce the negative effects of prolonged screen time, we create a program that detects the amount of time spent on the computer and notifies the user when it's time to take a break. This can help remind users to take regular breaks and reduce the risk of eye strain, headaches, and other associated symptoms. Such a program can be customized to suit individual preferences, including the frequency and duration of breaks, and can be an effective way to manage screen time and promote better overall health and productivity.

In addition to detecting the amount of time spent on the computer and reminding the user to take breaks, we designed that program to identify the user's emotions and respond accordingly. If the program detects that the user is feeling sad, the program asks a question from them to play their favourite music. It could help improve their mood.

By incorporating features like mood detection and personalized recommendations, the program can help users not only manage their screen time but also promote better mental health and overall well-being.
